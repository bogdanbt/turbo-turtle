# 🐢 Turbo Turtle

**"From turtle speed to turbo power!"**

Turbo Turtle is a fun, interactive web application designed to help developers and aspiring typists boost their **typing and coding speed under pressure**. Through time-limited challenges and quirky feedback, users go from painfully slow to impressively fast – all alongside a clueless (but determined) turtle mascot.

## 🦖 Why the Turtle?

Because **everyone starts slow**, and that's perfectly okay. Our turtle mascot reminds you that even slow beginnings can become turbo-charged through practice and persistence.

> "Even the slowest turtle eventually reaches the finish line."
